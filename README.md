# Company Layoffs (Data Cleaning)
A data cleaning project using SQL on a data set that represents the number and percentage of company layoffs from 2020 to 2023. 
This project works on:
  • Removing duplicate rows
  • Standardizing the data in each column
  • Populating NULL values when possible
  • Removing rows that have important data missing such as the number and pecentage of layoffs


# Company Layoffs (Exploratory Data Analysis)
In this SQL data exploration project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of layoffs data to identify temporal, geographical, industry-specific, and company-level trends. This project provided valuable insights into the patterns and dynamics of layoffs.
  • The temporal analysis revealed the timeframe of the layoffs and tracked the progression of layoffs monthly, quarterly,     and yearly, culminating in a comprehensive overview of the total rolling layoffs. 
  • Geographical trends were analyzed to pinpoint countries with the highest number of layoffs and to observe how these 
  trends evolved over time. 
  • Industry analysis highlighted the sectors most impacted by layoffs, ranking the percentage of layoffs within each 
  industry annually and comparing temporal trends across different industries. 
  • Company analysis focused on identifying companies with the highest layoffs, stages most prone to layoffs, companies that   completely shut down, and the top five companies with the highest layoffs each year.
